# @file Rclone S3 Mounts
# @brief This script configures Rclone to provide several S3-compliant mounts by leveraging CloudFlare R2
# @description
#     Install Doctor leverages Rclone and CloudFlare R2 to provide S3-compliant bucket mounts that allow you to retain stateful files and configurations.
#     In general, these buckets are used for backing up files like your browser profiles, Docker backup files, and other files that cannot be stored as
#     as code in your Install Doctor fork.
#
#     This script sets up Rclone to provide several folders that are synchronized with S3-compliant buckets (using CloudFlare R2 by default).
#     The script ensures required directories are created and that proper permissions are applied. This script will only run if `rclone` is
#     available in the `PATH`. It also requires the user to provide `CLOUDFLARE_R2_SECRET` and `CLOUDFLARE_R2_SECRET` as either environment variables
#     or through the encrypted repository-fork-housed method detailed in the [Secrets documentation](https://install.doctor/docs/customization/secrets).
#
#     ## Mounts
#
#     The script will setup five mounts by default and enable / start `systemd` services on Linux systems so that the mounts are available
#     whenever the device is turned on. The mounts are:
#
#     | Mount Location        | Description                                                                                                           |
#     |-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
#     | `/mnt/Private`        | Private system-wide bucket used for any private files that should not be able to be accessed publicly over HTTPS      |
#     | `/mnt/Public`         | Public system-wide bucket that can be accessed by anyone over HTTPS with the bucket's URL (provided by CloudFlare R2) |
#     | N/A                   | Private system-wide bucket used for storing Docker-related backups / files                                            |
#     | N/A                   | Private system-wide bucket similar to `/mnt/Private` but intended for system file backups                             |
#     | `$HOME/Public` | Private user-specific bucket (used for backing up application settings)                                               |
#
#     ## Permissions
#
#     The system files are all assigned proper permissions and are owned by the user `rclone` with the group `rclone`. The exception to this is the
#     user-specific mount which uses the user's user name and user group.
#
#     ## Samba
#
#     If Samba is installed, then by default Samba will create two shares that are symlinked to the `/mnt/s3-private` and `/mnt/s3-public`
#     buckets. This feature allows you to easily access the two buckets from other devices in your local network. If Rclone buckets are not
#     available then the Samba setup script will just create regular empty folders as shares.
#
#     ## Notes
#
#     * The mount services all leverage the executable found at `$HOME/.local/bin/rclone-mount` to mount the shares.
